"""Finetuning example.

Trains the DeepMoji model on the SemEval emotion dataset, using the 'last'
finetuning method and the class average F1 metric.

The 'last' method does the following:
0) Load all weights except for the softmax layer. Do not add tokens to the
   vocabulary and do not extend the embedding layer.
1) Freeze all layers except for the softmax layer.
2) Train.

The class average F1 metric does the following:
1) For each class, relabel the dataset into binary classification
   (belongs to/does not belong to this class).
2) Calculate F1 score for each class.
3) Compute the average of all F1 scores.
